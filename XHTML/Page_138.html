						<p>Unlike Example 7, though, none of the four equations is just a simple multiple of one of the other equations. Nevertheless, one of the four equations must be some combination of the other three in the sense that if we add the correct multiples of the first three equations, say, we would get the fourth equation. The key fact is that, with the three unknowns, we only need three pieces of information (3 equations) to solve the system (assuming that it has a solution). However, we then must check to be sure that the solution satisfies the remaining equation. The problem then becomes trying to decide which of the equations is redundantâ€”meaning which is a combination of the other equations and so provides no new information. It is always possible to determine, algebraically, not only which equation can be written in terms of the others, but also what that relationship is. However, this is a somewhat more complicated process and we will not go into it here.</p>
